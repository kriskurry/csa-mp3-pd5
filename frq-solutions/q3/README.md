## This question is about...
- Creating the methods `isWordChain` and `createList`
- `isWordChain` returns true if the element in the ArrayList has the previous element within it.
- `createList` takes in a target word and returns an ArrayList with all the words that start with the target.
## Struggles with this question...
- Understanding what the methods were supposed to do.
- The example with the visual helped clear things up.
## Prior Experiences...
- Learning how to use `.subString()`.
- Learning how to use `indexOf()`.
## What I Learned...
- You need to know the difference between ArrayLists and arrays.
